## Linker

A linker or link editor is a computer system program that takes one or more object files (generated by a compiler or an assembler) and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or another "object" file.

A simpler version that writes its output directly to memory is called the loader, though loading is typically considered a separate process.

This directory contains the working examples from the handwritten lecture, which you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Juke9SgAJTBseXUEzyf82n1hCPNnCjyf).

In the current chapter (toolchain), linking between static/dynamic libraries and source code is performed. If you are not familiar with compilation and linking, you can read this lecture. Otherwise, you can skip this document and read the article in the toolchain directory.
