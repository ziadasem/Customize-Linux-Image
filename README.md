## Linux Image Customization for Embedded Linux projects

The repository offers a discussion on customizing Linux images to fit a custom target, primarily based on chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 from `Mastering Embedded Linux Programming, Third Edition` by Frank Vasquez and Chris Simmonds, along with some other resources.

Each chapter includes a README file with a complete discussion of the topic and other related artifacts.

This repository is part of the Embedded Linux Course and will be expanded with summaries and exercises from additional chapters in the future. For more resources of Embbedded Linux System, please see the [Linux System Admin repo](https://github.com/ziadasem/Linux-System-Admin), [Modern C++](https://github.com/ziadasem/modern-cpp-crash-course), and  the [Embedded Linux Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E9dFgduPg2835RwebUoiKIaREmExyoyW), which include all course materials such as handwritten notes, GitHub repositories, slides, and references.
